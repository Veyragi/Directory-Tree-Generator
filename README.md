# 🌳 Directory Tree Generator

A simple, cross-platform Python script that generates a visual directory tree structure, similar to the `tree` command on Linux and macOS. This project was created as a practical exercise to understand and implement **recursion** for file system traversal. It uses only Python's standard libraries, so it runs anywhere Python is installed — with **zero dependencies**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Practice recursive programming using a real-world file system traversal problem.
- Create a lightweight and portable tool for visually mapping directory structures.
- Provide a command-line utility that works seamlessly across platforms.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Standard Library**: `os` (for file and directory traversal)
- **Framework**: None – completely dependency-free

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Visual Directory Mapping**: Creates a clean, easy-to-read visual map of any folder's structure.
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on **Windows**, **macOS**, and **Linux** with no modifications.
- ✅ **Zero Dependencies**: Uses only Python's built-in `os` module.
- ✅ **Lightweight & Fast**: Scans and prints directory structures quickly and efficiently.
- ✅ **Educational Value**: Great example of how to use recursion to solve practical problems.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Save the Script**: Save the code as `generate_tree.py`.

2. **Navigate to a Folder**: Open a terminal or command prompt and use `cd` to navigate to the directory you want to scan.

3. **Place the Script**: Ensure `generate_tree.py` is inside the folder you want to analyze.

4. **Run the Command**:
   ```bash
   python generate_tree.py
